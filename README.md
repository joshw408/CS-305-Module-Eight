  **Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?**
  Artemis Financial, is a growing financial institution. They are focused on integrating advanced security measures into its current software infrastructure. The company’s goal is to protect sensitive client data, improve system resilience, and demonstrate its ongoing commitment to provide secure and reliable financial services.
    
  **What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?**
  I enjoyed using static testing to uncover and understand possible vulnerabilities in my code. Secure coding goes beyond preventing bugs as it’s about protecting the trust users place in a product. When sensitive information or proprietary data is compromised, the impact can be devastating to both individuals and organizations. Developing secure software not only strengthens data protection but also reinforces a company’s reputation for reliability and responsibility.
    
  **Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?**
  The dependency check tool was the most helpful, as it created a shortcut in detecting vulnerabilities compared to checking each dependency by hand for vulnerabilities.
    
  **How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?**
  Testing revealed that many of the identified vulnerabilities were the result of outdated or unsupported libraries. Updating these libraries not only mitigated existing risks but also strengthened the application’s overall security posture. Looking ahead, I plan to integrate penetration testing as part of the development process to more thoroughly evaluate the software and identify hidden or evolving vulnerabilities within the codebase.
  
  **How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?**
While developing the software, I continuously performed debugging to confirm proper functionality and stability. Once the code was refactored, I executed a follow-up vulnerability assessment to validate that the modifications had not introduced any new security flaws or performance issues.

  **What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?**
  Secure coding habits will be useful in every future project I work on, helping me write more reliable and protected code. I also plan to continue using tools like the OWASP Dependency Check to quickly identify and address vulnerabilities before they can impact application security.
  
  **Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?**
  The Vulnerability Assessment and Practices for Secure Software reports are strong examples of the security principles I’ve learned and applied. Alongside these, the refactored Project Two application demonstrates my ability to integrate self-signed certificates into a RESTful API, reinforcing both my technical understanding and my commitment to secure software design.
